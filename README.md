# SITE FEEDBACK / ISSUES

Repo to host the issues for my site (link TBA). This means
if you see anything on my site that is broken, open up an issue here.
This includes things crashing, things not working like usual, and so on.

**NOTE: I cannot guarantee timely responses to issues,** so please don't make one expecting
I'll get back to you on the next day or even eventually. Also feature requests are definitely not guaranteed
so don't write them with the expectation they'll be done.

## Are you cartmanlanding the site's source code?

The source is on a private repository which is also responsible for syncing with whatever deploys it. If I wanted to open source this thing
I will have to somehow decouple this, and this gets a bit too messy. Maybe once I fix that I might open source
some parts of the site.
